# Migration plan: replace the landing page, then migrate existing clans

Status: proposed rollout sequence. No routing, hosting, content, bot or OAuth
changes are performed by this document. Implementation review is PR #1.

## Decision and scope

Separate two releases:

1. Replace the basic GitHub Pages landing page at `clan.l33t.xyz` with the Django
   website studio. Existing clan subdomains keep their current hosting.
2. Migrate existing clans individually, preserving their public hostnames and
   reviewed content. Retire the legacy frontend/API dependency only after the
   last dependent clan has moved.

This avoids making the main-site launch wait for all content exports, and avoids
making a landing-page cutover unexpectedly switch established communities.
Keep the repository, history and useful wiki documentation. Retiring GitHub
Pages hosting does not mean deleting the repository or the legacy source.

## Evidence and inventory

- The canonical root currently serves the basic repository-derived landing page.
  GitHub Pages is configured from `master` at `/`, with the canonical custom domain.
- The [public clan directory](https://github.com/l33t-xyz/clan.l33t.xyz/wiki/Clans)
  lists established clan subdomains. Treat this as a starting list, not a complete
  DNS, owner or content inventory. The legacy README describes the separate
  Vercel/Airtable stack used by those sites.
- Legacy source renders a collection of tabs from `public_pages`, uses the first
  attachment as each page's cover and evaluates MDX. A members tab has separate
  session-aware behavior. The replacement must not assume these are all ordinary
  public rich-text pages or invent a legacy path structure from tab names.
- Current import is source-preserving, draft-only and offline. It does **not**
  convert MDX/Markdown, fetch attachments, map site metadata or preserve private
  member functionality. Tests of this importer are not full migration acceptance.

Before any cutover, record exact DNS origin/proxy/TTL settings, hostnames,
certificates, redirects, serving revisions and owner identities in private
operator records. Back up source exports and original attachments there too;
never commit real member data, credentials or private exports here.

## Release A — main site and controlled beta

### A1. Finish the launch prerequisites

- Review and merge the approved implementation; deploy the exact reviewed source
  to an independent persistent preview with its own database/runtime.
- Complete [hosted acceptance](../../../django/deploy/README.md): real Discord
  login, logout and returning-user identity; create/edit/upload/preview/publish;
  two-user isolation; valid HTTPS; no local demo action in hosted mode.
- Reserve **all** established clan handles before enabling creation. The code's
  current default reservation of one handle is not a complete inventory.
- Start with a small, explicitly provisioned beta. Add a server-enforced allowlist
  or invitation gate before advertising restricted onboarding; the current
  create-site view is not invitation-only. Keep the new-site creation gate closed
  until ownership reservations and hosted acceptance pass.
- Use central-host-only sign-in and cookies, explicit permitted hosts and trusted
  HTTPS proxy configuration. Exclude authenticated/editor/API routes from CDN
  caching. Validate public-cache invalidation on publication and unpublication.
- Verify database backups include image blobs and demonstrate a restore into a
  disposable database. Add basic uptime/error visibility and an operator contact.
- Confirm root-site links and onboarding copy accurately distinguish active
  features from a not-yet-connected bot. Billing and donations are not launch
  blockers; do not advertise an implemented paid subscription.

Exit: a persistent preview with a real owner account can complete the full
workflow, and the recovered database also serves its pages and images.

### A2. Switch only the main hostname

- Capture previous routing and a legacy source revision for rollback. Confirm
  whether the DNS provider proxies the origin; public DNS alone may hide it.
- Prepare the destination vhost and certificate for `clan.l33t.xyz`, configure
  the canonical production origin and register its exact Discord callback.
- With explicit cutover approval, switch only the main hostname to the new
  origin. Leave existing tenant records, wildcard records and unrelated domain
  records untouched. Purge only stale main-site cache entries as necessary.
- Verify from outside the host: canonical HTTPS, login callback, account return,
  editor, image delivery, publish/unpublish and useful 404s. Confirm the existing
  tenant hostnames still route to their prior services.
- Use a recommended 72-hour observation window, covering prior DNS/cache TTLs,
  before retiring the old Pages deployment. This is an operational acceptance
  window, not a promise that DNS always takes 72 hours.

Exit: the main domain serves Django reliably; existing clans are unaffected.

### A3. Retire the basic GitHub Pages deployment

Only after main-domain acceptance and propagation:

1. Confirm no relevant DNS records still target GitHub Pages.
2. Disable branch-based Pages publishing by setting its source to **None**.
   Unpublishing a deployment alone is insufficient because another source-branch
   commit can republish it. See [GitHub's source-change procedure](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/deleting-a-github-pages-site)
   and [unpublish behavior](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/unpublishing-a-github-pages-site).
3. Remove the obsolete Pages custom-domain binding and root `CNAME` through a
   reviewed cleanup after the routing switch, not before. Retain any independent
   domain-verification record unless its removal is separately needed.
4. Replace legacy onboarding instructions with the new editor/Discord workflow;
   label historical Airtable/Next.js instructions accordingly. Preserve the wiki
   and repository. Record what will happen to any discovered `github.io` links;
   disabling Pages does not itself provide redirects for that old hostname.
5. Verify the canonical root still works and a subsequent normal source update
   cannot accidentally restore the old Pages deployment.

Do not disable Vercel or the old content API in this step: established clans may
still depend on them.

## Release B — migrate existing clans one at a time

### B1. Build the reviewed migration manifest

For each clan, collect site metadata, ordered pages, stable source record IDs,
slugs, public/private classification, original attachment files and checksums,
current links/anchors, theme/cover mappings and verified Discord owner subjects.
Export source data; a cached public crawl is supporting evidence, not an
up-to-date or complete substitute for the source export.

Resolve these implementation gaps before importing live content:

- Safe Markdown-to-editor conversion and an explicit mapping for any MDX widgets;
  never execute imported JSX. Preserve code blocks, whitespace and game-specific
  text. Flag unsupported formatting for manual review.
- Asset import into MySQL with same-tenant link rewriting, duplicate detection,
  original-file retention and a report for files exceeding format/size limits.
  Preserve per-page covers as reviewed inline images or extend the model; do not
  silently collapse all page covers into one site image.
- Explicit, repeatable source-to-target IDs and dry-run reconciliation reports.
  Do not blindly rerun imports or overwrite later editor changes.
- Explicit handling of the seeded `home` page: the current importer rejects a
  slug already present. Import into a reviewed empty tenant or migrate the pristine
  starter page intentionally; never silently delete a user-edited page.
- Preserve page ordering and select the correct home page. Verify actual legacy
  URLs/anchors; add redirects or a compatibility page only where needed. URL
  fragments are not sent to the server, so hash-only navigation requires browser
  compatibility handling, not a server redirect rule alone.
- Keep private/member-only source data outside published pages. Public migration
  can proceed with private material withheld and explicitly recorded. Full private
  member-area parity requires additional reader authorization, not editor roles.
- Set transitional per-clan allowances to fit existing pages, assets and revision
  overhead. Do not truncate a legacy site to the five-page free default or require
  payment just to preserve existing content. Commercial terms remain undecided.

### B2. Pilot one established clan

- Have the verified owner log in with Discord, then assign the reserved tenant;
  no self-service claiming of established names.
- Dry-run import, reconcile counts/checksums/links/visibility and render previews.
  Review every page and image with the owner before publishing.
- Freeze legacy edits briefly; take a final export/diff and reconcile it. Avoid
  simultaneous editing of the same clan in both systems.
- Prepare the exact tenant hostname certificate and host routing. A certificate
  for `*.l33t.xyz` does not cover `name.clan.l33t.xyz`; verify coverage for the
  actual host or `*.clan.l33t.xyz` plus the main hostname separately.
- Publish approved pages and move only that tenant's DNS/routing with explicit
  cutover authority. Verify its home, navigation, media, old links, privacy and
  mobile presentation on the real hostname.
- Observe the pilot before repeating for the next clan. Keep unmigrated tenants
  on their existing services and retain all source backups.

### B3. Connect the builder and retire remaining legacy dependencies

Provision one isolated, tenant-scoped builder pilot after the website flow is
stable. Verify real guild/channel/user routing, current membership, revocation,
draft-only permissions and cross-tenant refusal. The existing bot endpoint must
not be replaced blindly. Review/merge/activation of the pending routine remains
separate from merely having an MCP adapter in source.

After all dependent clans pass migration acceptance, retire unused legacy
frontend/API integrations and old table-service access individually. Confirm
shared services have no unrelated consumers. Keep exports and source history;
no database, account or repository deletion is implied by deprecation.

## Rollback without losing new work

Before cutover, retain origin records, configs, source revisions and database
snapshots. On a failed cutover, route the affected hostname back only if the
legacy service is actually healthy. Preserve the new database and uploaded
assets; never restore an old snapshot over newer edits. If writes occurred,
freeze editing and reconcile/export them before reopening legacy editing. If the
legacy service was already broken, use a pre-reviewed static fallback or hold
page instead of calling a return to that broken origin a successful rollback.

## Next milestone

An independently hosted preview with real Discord sign-in and verified restore,
followed by approval of the **main-domain-only** cutover. Existing-clan migration
waits for reviewed exports and ownership mapping; billing is a later release.
